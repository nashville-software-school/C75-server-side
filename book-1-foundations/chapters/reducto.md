# Reductio & Absurdum :mage: :magic_wand:

Reductio & Absurdum have been providing high-quality magical supplies to the wizarding community for nearly 1000 years at their shop on Calendula Road. Red has been insisting on modernizing for years, and Abe has finally agreed to start digitizing their records.

## Initial Project Requirements

1. You will build a new .NET console app, starting from scratch.
1. Create a main menu with working options to view all products, view products for a category, add a product to the inventory, delete a product from the inventory, and update a product's details
1. Products have a name, price (as a decimal), a boolean to indicate whether they are still available, and a DaysOnShelf int that's calculated based on the date the product was entered in the system. They also have a ProductTypeId, which categorize them into the following categories: apparel, potions, enchanted objects, and wands. When adding a product to the inventory, the user should be able to choose from these options to add a product type id to the new product.
1. Product Types have Name and Id properties.
1. Use LINQ methods when possible. 
1. Use try/catch blocks to handle possible exceptions.
