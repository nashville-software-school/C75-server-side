# Exomine API 
For this project, you should build the API for the Exomine React app we built in the first half of the course. Either choose a version that you worked on or talk to an instructor about getting another working codebase for the client side application.

## Project Set-Up
1. Start by creating a new Git repository within your cohort organization, then have all teammates clone it.
1. One person should set up a dotnet project in a new folder, as you have before, then commit that initial code.
1. Review your client-side code and list all the endpoints that you need to provide to replace the json-server that we put in place before.
1. Create a Git project board with all the issues to complete this API, then start assigning those.
1. Build the API. Please reach out to an instructor if you have questions or want to confirm that you're on the right track.

Note: it's easier to constantly check your work with Postman than to do it through the client application. If you define your requirements carefully, then once you have endpoints built, it should work smoothly with the existing React app.
